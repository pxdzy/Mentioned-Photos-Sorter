# About Photo Sorter

This project is used to check what photos you're mentioned in. Typically on rec.net you would have to scroll thousands of photos just to go back and that's it the website doesn't break. With this project you can use different filters to choose what photos you're looking for

For support, questions, and suggestions contact "pxdzy" on discord

# How To Use
Load up the app and enter an account name in the "Enter Account Name" section.

Click Load, This will then load all the photos you're mentioned in as long as they are public. If you don't have access to an image without being logged in you wont be able to see it.

If you click an image itself it will bring you to the rec.net photo itself

# Filters
To get more precise with your photo finding endevours click the "Filter" button and select how you want to filter the images.

Filter By Username. You can enter a username in and select to either include or exclude certain account names

Sort Order. If you click onto the box it will drop down with 2 options. Oldest First, Newest First. This will decide on what order it will display in.

Year. This will check all the years the photos were in. Lets say you were in a photo in 2019 and 2021 only. Only 2019 and 2021 will display on the drop down.
